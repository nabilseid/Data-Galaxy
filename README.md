# Intro To DE

## What is data engineering

- Gather data from different sources: ingest data
- Optimize database for analysis: make fetching query fast

**DE are masters in databases.**

**Processing large amount of data using cluster of machines.**

- To remove corrupt data, to aggregate or to join data
- Know the to abstraction of processing tools and know their limitations

**Scheduling tools to run jobs at a specific interval**

### Existing tools

| Database | Processing | Scheduling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL | Spark | Airflow |
| PostgreSQL | Hive | oozie |
|  |  | Cron |

**A data pipeline**

collect data from different source   →  process it  →  load it in an analytics data warehouse

**Cloud computing**

- Cost efficient
- Database reliability
